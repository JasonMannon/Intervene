Intervention Type|DescriptionParent Outreach|School staff should keep parents informed of their child's behavior and enlist parents as partners in addressing areas of concern. Outreach to parents can include, but is not limited to, a phone call and/or written communication.Short-Term Behavioral Progress Reports|Teachers and/or principals may send behavioral progress reports to parents on a regular basis until they feel that the student is in control of his/her behavior and working in the classroom successfully.Guidance Conference|"Principals and teachers may request a guidance conference with the student and, where appropriate, with the parent. The purpose of the conference is to review the behavior, find solutions to the problem and address academic, personal and social issues that might have caused or contributed to the behavior."Development of Individual Behavior Contract|"The student meets with teachers to create a written contract that includes objectives and the specific performance tasks that the student will accomplish to meet those objectives. The contract is signed by the student and teacher and, where appropriate, by the parent."Intervention by Counseling Staff|"Where available, school-based counseling personnel and/or School-Based Mental Health programs offer a wide range of comprehensive and confidential mental health services and interventions including, but not limited to: assessments, individual, group and family therapy, teacher consultations and educational strategies for parents and staff."Referral to PPT (Pupil Personnel Team)|Pupil Personnel Teams are school-based teams that utilize a multidisciplinary approach to encourage student success through prevention and intervention strategies and supports. A case manager is identified for each student referral so that an individualized plan can be created to help students overcome their academic and/or socio-emotional difficulties.Referral to a Community Based Organization (CBO)|"Students may be referred to a community-based organization for a wide range of services including after-school programming, individual or group counseling, leadership development, conflict resolution and tutoring."Referral to Appropriate Substance Abuse Counseling Services|"In the case where a student is presenting problems with substance abuse, including the use, possession or distribution of illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia, and/or alcohol, referrals should be made to counseling services that are either inside the school or through an outside community-based organization."Individual/Group Counseling|"Counseling provides students with an outlet to share issues in privacy that may be negatively impacting their attendance, behavior, and/or academic success. Students discuss and formulate goals, and learn problem solving strategies that will enable them to overcome a variety of personal challenges. Counselors will conference with parents on a regular basis to discuss the student's academic and personal progress."Community Service (with Parental Consent)|"Students may be provided with community service opportunities so that they gain a greater appreciation of their school neighborhoods and develop skills to become positive social change agents. Community service can help students occupy their time with positive activities, avoid negative behavior and learn the value of service to others."Mentoring Program|"A mentoring program matches a mentor who may be a counselor, teacher, student and/or leader with a protege.

Neither mediation nor conflict resolution are, under any circumstances, appropriate interventions for bias-based bullying, intimidation or harassment."Referral to Counseling Services for Youth Relationship Abuse or Sexual Violence|"When one person uses a pattern of threatened or actual physical, sexual, and/or emotional abuse to control a dating partner, the school should refer both the victim and the student who engages in this behavior to separate appropriate school or community-based agencies for counseling, support, and education.
